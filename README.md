# 🛠️ SQL Capstone Project

<b>📖 Overview</b><br>
This project showcases advanced SQL skills by solving real-world business problems using a structured relational database. The project covers:<br>
1.Data exploration<br>
2.Complex query building<br>
3.Aggregation, ranking, and joins<br>
4.Performance optimization techniques<br>
The dataset involves tables related to business domains such as customers, sales, products, orders, and territories.<br>

<b>🎯 Objective</b><br>
The main objectives of the project are:<br>
To analyze business performance using SQL.<br>
To extract meaningful insights from the database.<br>
To answer complex business questions using SQL queries.<br>

<b>🗂️ Dataset Structure</b><br>
The database contains the following tables:<br>
1.Customers: Information about customers (e.g., name, location, income).<br>
2.Products: Details about products (e.g., SKU, category, price).<br>
3.Sales: Transactional data (e.g., order date, product sold, revenue).<br>
4.Orders: Details about orders (e.g., order ID, date, quantity).<br>
5.Territories: Sales territories and their regions.<br>
Each table is related by foreign keys, making the database fully normalized.<br>

<b>🛠️ SQL Concepts Used</b><br>
Joins: INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL OUTER JOINs.<br>
Aggregations: SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), GROUP BY.<br>
Ranking Functions: RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), DENSE_RANK().<br>
Date Functions: MONTH(), YEAR(), DATEDIFF().<br>
Subqueries and CTEs: Simplifying complex queries.<br>
Optimization Techniques: Indexing and query execution plans.<br>
